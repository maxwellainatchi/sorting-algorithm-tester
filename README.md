# To Do

- Bug: running tests too many times crashes the page
  - Caused by success animation (temporarily disabled), figure out why
- Add auto-save
- Add a features list
- UseReducer for better state management
- Add dark mode to localstorage/cookie
- Make more generic so it can use any problem set
  - Use custom success logic
  - Use arbitrary function names
  - Use a problems folder to load supported problems
