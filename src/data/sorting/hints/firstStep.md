Assuming you had an already sorted array, would you be able to insert another element into it in a way that would keep the array sorted?

E.g. if you had the array `[1,3,5,6]`, and you were given the number `4` to insert, you should return an array of `[1,3,4,5,6]`.

Hint: try putting this as a separate function, `insertIntoSortedArray(number, array)`, and see how you would be able to use that to create the sorting algorithm.
