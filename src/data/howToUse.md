## About Automated Tests

Each test will automatically run your code, passing in a specific input and checking to make sure that it matches the expected output. For example, if you had an `addOne` function that takes a single number and adds one to it, a very basic test might look like this:

```javascript
function testAddOne(addOne) {
  const result = addOne(5);
  return result === 6;
}
```

### Running tests

There are two ways to run tests - all at once with the "Run All" button, or individually with the "Run" button on the test.
